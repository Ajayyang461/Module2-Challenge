Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Module 2 Challenge

Purpose of this challege is to develop a web application from scratch and build a portfolio from the things we have learned from class.

I have learned many elements, propertys and values that can be utilized with html and css to make a responisive web application. Also using flexbox was the greatest challege and the most complex for the most part. 

I do plan on adding some more feature along the way so it can be more mordern looking and more responsive in the futre.
